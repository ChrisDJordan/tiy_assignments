#Getting Typographic


Today we were tasked with five different typographical concepts for our restaurant project. It of course seemed like an easy task, But was definitely more challenging than I thought. Good design does doesn't come easy, and is definitely a skill not something you're just burning with.....well maybe but not me. I've always felt like I knew what looked good, but if you can't walk the walk...you get the point. I spent an hour in the bouldin creek getting a feel for everything, and with the hell of a good friend manage to get some good photos too. I looked at menus to pull ideas for typefaces, and tried to translate there message. Afterward I switch over to typecast and of course Crash! Goodbye hard work. I quickly tried not to freak out and moved into photoshop. In the end I decided to keep it clean, but with a little edge, I wanted to keep an organic feel and highlight the vegetarian dishes. I did one a little bit fancy based on one of the menus I found while there, here's the psd's to check them out.
