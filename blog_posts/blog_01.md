#Who am I?  
##And what is this code? 

There are many things in life that are    
challenging, and The Iron Yard is definitely   
one on the top of my list.  

The past two weeks we've dived into html, css, git, and the terminal.    
It's  been a super exciting/anxiety driven blast that I wouldn't take back.    
Each and every day I found myself wondering "can I do this"? while picking    
myself up off the ground with each line of code.

I couldn't ask for better support from class mates and help from a teacher  
who really loves what she does. You can just feel the positive vibes  
from the everyone here. While each morning until every evening is a   
rollercoaster, I know I made the right decision and I couldn't be any happier.

I'm coding    
And this is crazy    
Here's my Codepen
