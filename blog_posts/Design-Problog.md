What may sound like good in your head isn't always    
good on paper or even for the client for that matter.    

While learning more about the process in which websites    
are created, I really see a structure. A process to the    
madness which is truely important and definitely need.  
There is so much that goes in to a website that being  
sporadic isn't going to meet deadlines.  

I think designers are a bit crazy, and need to be. The ones that stand  
out take chances, and break the mold. I also see where It could be easy  
to get carried away.  

Working with clients and meeting their goals is  
going to be an interesting experience. Jumping out of what   
I like and focusing on what the clients needs will be key.
