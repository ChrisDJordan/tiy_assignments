#Quest Austin Redesign

##History and Intro
Twenty-two years ago, a group of watersport enthusiasts were looking for the right  
property to create the perfect lake. After years of searching they felt they were on  
a quest for the perfect property. They found that property in Southeast Austin and after  
years of enjoyment, they decided to take the facility to the next level and develop a  
full-sized cable park – and Quest ATX was born.  

Quest ATX is Austin’s first and only cable wakepark with big ambition to become a complete  
action sports destination. Set on 130 uniquely-manicured acres, and located close to the new  
Circuit of the Americas, Quest ATX is a world class wakeboarding facility. The park is equipped  
with a six-tower Sesitec system, UNIT Parktec rails and a System 2.0. Pairing Austin’s ‘Keep It  
Weird’ vibe with a of land of endless possibilities, Quest ATX is set to be one of the most unique   
cable wakeboard parks in the United States.

The Quest staff has over a decade of experience in the cable wake boarding industry as well  
as a love for Austin’s outdoor active lifestyle. Their goal for Quest ATX is to promote that  
lifestyle for all ages, throughout Austin, and it’s surrounding communities.  

##Project Issues and Goals

While Quest ATX provides an awesome atmosphere for beginners to the most advanced  
riders, it doesn't come to life on their website. They also miss showcasing what  
makes them stand out from other parks   
 
###Pros: 
-only place with a mountain biking park  
-provides an encouraging environment   
-available for private parties  
-professional instructors available   

###Cons:
Lack of information about:

-personal mountain biking trial  
-what rails and jumps they have  
-professional instructors  
        
###Goals:
-improve clarity on what quest has to offer  
-bring the excitement of wakeboarding with typography and photography  
-show the unique rails and jumps   

##Audience
-local wakeboarders  
-beginners to the sport   
-children  
-families  
-riders from other states and countries  


##Competitive Market Study

###Competitors and what they offer:  

####Texas ski ranch
-family friendly  
-sand beach at cable lake  
-boat lake  
-skatepark    
-snowboard park    
-fish taco restaurant   
-trampoline room    
-camps  
   
Texas ski ranch is currently the main competitor being that they're the  
closest to quest. TSR, values family fun over all else and provides the most  
activities in one area.      

####Next level ride
-wakeboard facility in austin tx    
-possibly better features at the park  

Next level ride, will be the top competition When opened because  
they will offer a cable lake much like quest in austin tx. 


####BSR
-restaurant   
-multiple cable parks  
-super slide  
-lazy river  
-camps  

BSR is the furthest away from quest, and  provides an experience much like TSR.  
The competition with BSR will be with people from out of town looking to wakeboard. 


##SWOT

###Strengths
-first cable lake in Austin  
-mountain biking  
-private parties  
-camps  
-private training  
-less tourists  

###Weaknesses
lack of info about:   
-mountain biking  
-rails and jumps  
	

-facility offers fewest activities compared to TSR and BSR  
-location is harder to find than competition  


###Opportunities
-showcase mountain biking   
-show more of the facility  
-explaining what makes them different than their competitiion  
-bring more activities to location  
-show off sponsors for Quest  



###Threats
-being out done by competition    
-becoming out dated    
-cable parks in Austin being built   


##Keywords
-local  
-family  
-fun  
-wakeboarding  
-cable lake  

##This not That
cable lake not boat lake  
current not old school  
supportive not uncarring  
local not mass produced  
summer not winter  


##Game Plan
The game plan for this project is to bring out what makes quest stand out from   
their competitors, and manage their content well. Bringing excitement to wakeboarding,    
and what makes it cool will be a big goal. I will provide information for newcomers to    
the sport about to expect, and show off the supportive environment. Quest offers a great    
facility with activities that no one has, they keep the laid-back Austin feel, without    
intent of becoing to big. I intend on showcasing their fun supportive atmosphere.
