            <p><span>Hi I'm Chris<span></p>

            <p>I'm currently studying UI design at The Iron Yard. Art has always been my greatest passion because of the sheer freedom it brings, and how it's not generalized to one form. </p>
            <br />


			<p>I grew up In New Braunfels, TX where I spent most of my time skateboarding, wake boarding, and writing music. The style and culture of these activities has played a big role I my life, some which will shape my designs in the future. I now reside in San Marcos, TX with my wife and five month old daughter. In our free time we like to hike, and try interesting fruit like durian. I tend to stick with bands and not try new ones all the time. You will usually hear me jamming Manchester Orchestra, and now Emancipator for task motivation. </p>
