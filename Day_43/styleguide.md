#Bouldin Creek Cafe

Bouldin Creek Cafe opened in May of 2000. It was born out of both the desire
to build community and preserve the character of an artsy laid 
back college town in the midst of growth and development.
At first a small menu was provided as a means of bringing
people together, but as people relished the unique vegetarian 
offerings, Bouldin Creek evolved into a full-scale vegetarian
eatery and reputable coffee bar.

As of 2008 Bouldin Creek has been in a large location, and has faced challenges 
with keeping their at home feel. Based on customer research, the site feels very
outdated and the colors make it hard to navigate. There's a lot of interesting 
info about Bouldin, but it's hidden within the content without any hierarchy.
The menu has more links than needed and makes you wonder why they couldn't have been together.

My goals for the Bouldin Creek project are to keep the "keep Austin weird" feel, but 
bring a fresh style to the website. I plan to bring a familiar color system that shows off their fun personality. By offsetting content, I will show off their eclectic nature. I also want to take out any unessesary menu links that could easily be combinded.
