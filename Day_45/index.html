				<h1>intro</h1>
				<p>Bouldin Creek Cafe opened in May of 2000. It
					was born out of both the desire to build
					community and preserve the character of an artsy
					laid back college town in the midst of growth and
					development. At first a small menu was provided
					as a means of bringing people together, but as
					people relished the unique vegetarian offerings,
					Bouldin Creek evolved into a full-scale vegetarian
				eatery and reputable coffee bar.</p>
				<p>As of 2008, Bouldin Creek has been in a large
					locationtt and has faced challenges with keeping
					their at home feel. Based on customer research,
					the site feels very outdated and the colors make it
					hard to navigate. There's a lot of interesting info
					about Bouldin, but it's hidden within the content
					without any hierarchy.The menu has more links
					than needed and makes you wonder why they
				vcouldn't have been together.</p>
				<p>My goals for the Bouldin Creek project are to keep
					the "keep Austin weird" feel, but bring a fresh style
					to the website. I plan to bring a familiar color
					system that shows off their fun personality. By
					offsetting content, I will show off their eclectic
					nature. I also want to take out any unessesary
				menu links that could easily be combinded.</p>

				<h2>Process</h2>
				<h3>Research</h3>
				<p>The process started by researching the Bouldin
					Creek website as much as possible. I wanted to
					really understand who they were, and what  they
					were all about. Later on, I spent time at the cafe
					trying to get a feel for the atmosphere. I spent
					time around every corner of the restaurant getting
					pictures with my photographer friend, Chris. As we
				looked around I could see a common color pallet.</p>

				<h3>word list and site map</h3>
				<p>Once I took in everything from Bouldin Creek, I
					quickly wrote down every word I could think of.
					After going over my list, I asked a few people that
					have been there to see what words they
					thought of. Once I got my list started, I dived into
					the site again. I looked over all of the unesscessary
				content and tried to combined whatever I could.</p>

				<img src="images/sitemap-small.jpg">
				<h3>style tile</h3>
				<p>I came up with three style tiles, and let critiques
					help me pin point the best one. A few adjustments
					were made later on in the comp phase to color, but
					I knew at this point the direction to go in, and it was
				time to bring my sketches to life in photoshop. </p>
				<img src="images/styletile-small.jpg">
				<h3>layout</h3>
				<p>My sketchesing spree ended with layouts, I drew
					quickly, and tried not to worry about the details. I
					ended up wih ten sketches of possible ideas for
					the layout. I narrowed it down to two, and decided
				to let a wireframe help me decide the winner. </p>
				<img src="images/layout2-small.jpg">
				<img src="images/layout1-small.jpg">
				<h3>wireframes</h3>
				<p>When deisgning the wireframes, I started to see
					places were my sketches needed improvement.
					With a few tweeks, and an extra image about
					Bouldin Creeks ranking, I was on my way to
				incorperate color from my style tile. </p>
				<img src="images/wireframe-small.jpg">
				<h3>comps</h3>
				<p>Once color was introduced, things really started
					to become more clear. I realized pretty quickly
					that yellow text doesn’t contrast well over a white
					background (even though I wanted it to.) I also
					added a black background with an opacity to the
					ranking img text. It becomes difficult at times to
					see white text over images, and the black helped
				for clarity.</p>

					<h2>typography</h2>
					<p>To keep it fun, and give it a clean, organic feel,
						Tablet Gothic Compressed  was used for all
						of the headers. Fira Sans 2  was used for the

						and body copy will be kept low-case to keep the
					care-free vibe.</p>

					<h2>color</h2>
					<p>The colors chosen for Bouldin Creek were
						based off of  the bright colors used outside
						the restaurant and the vegetarian food inside.
						The plan was to give it a whimslical feel,
						without overloading the site with content.
					</p>
					<h3>primary colors</h3>
					<p>Primary colors will be used for the menu header,
						h1, h2, and links. Use white instead of darkred
					on header navigational links. </p>

				<h2>grid</h2>
				<p>The grid system used for Bouldin Creek is made
					by using a media querie with percentages.
					The 16 column grid starts after the first querie
					and doesn’t have a gutter, making it easier to put
					images together. Before and after, in css, is used
					for the header and footer after the first  media
				querie.</p>
				<p>@mixin grid ($col-num){
					width: ($col * $col-num)+($gut * (($col-num)-1));
					margin-right: $gut;
