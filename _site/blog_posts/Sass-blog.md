#Lets Sassercise!  

Sass brings a warm fuzzy happiness to my heart, one which I didn't see coming.  
I like css, but it's lacking fluidity to its brother html.  

While I'm still working on a full understanding of sass as a language  
I can't help but wonder why css wasn't doing this already.  
Nesting makes things far more intuitive, and gets rid of so many annoying classes.  
Mix-ins, which can be complex are so useful for staying organized and not think   
"what was that hex code?"  

While there is still so much to learn I can't help but thank  
Hampton Catlin for making my life easier. We're in a day and age   
where things should be more simple. I thank those that delt  
with the crazy, and have contributed to fixing the issues.
